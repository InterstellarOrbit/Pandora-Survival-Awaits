About Johnabcs1/InterstellarOrbit: Truly, the best gift to someone who loves space is to give them a movie that truly inspires them. On my 9th Birthday, I recieved a copy of Avatar when it just came out for DVD. It still remains my favorite 
movie, ahead of The Martian and Interstellar.

I started playing Rimworld when Alpha 14 came out. I started messing around with creating mods when a16 came out. And now, the idea of this mod came to me when looking for a new background for my Desktop. 

The point of this document is to not say that I just thought of making this mod just to do it, it is to say that I am a true fan of the Avatar franchise. Immense Research, Editing and Coding was and will 
continue to be put into this mod.
